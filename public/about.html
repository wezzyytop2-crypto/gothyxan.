    <h2 class="fade-in">Our Story</h2>
    <p class="fade-in">
        Gothyxan was founded in Transnistria — a region known for its 
        raw, industrial aesthetic and underground culture. Influenced by 
        Eastern European street life, we began by reselling rare branded 
        pieces to a small but passionate community.
    </p>

    <p class="fade-in">
        As demand grew, we evolved into a curated gothic-streetwear store, 
        combining modern silhouettes with bold dark aesthetics. Today, 
        every product is handpicked, staying true to our roots and 
        preserving the spirit of Transnistrian underground fashion.
